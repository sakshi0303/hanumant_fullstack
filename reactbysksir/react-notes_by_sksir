>>>react is javascript library
>it has re-usable component, decrease app size and fast
>it has single page Application ( if we click on one link the Page doesnt reload)
    > whole DOM is recreated agian and again on load< react doesnt load again and again>
> it has hooks and props
> Component: A reuseable piece of code . It is of 2 types
      > Function Component  
          >declare normal js fucntion and return atleast one element
          > this is the simpler way of defining component in react. fucntion component can be declare just like nornal function in javascript that must return react element.
      > Class Component:

>>Main.js(throuh npm create vite@latest)/index.js (npx create-react-app frontend)
>App.js (serving of components)

> Component:
    Home.js
    About.jsx
    ContactJS.jsx
    NavBar.jsx

props:  with the help of props we can pass data from parent component to child component

vice-versa is possible 

>npx create-react-app frotnend
>npm start
>rename App.js to App.jsx
>create componeet and router , do rafce
>npm i react-router-dom
