callstack if element is not time taking it go to  web api

and  i  does not take time: it goes to call stack
if i takes time or cllback function it goes to webapi 

from webapi it will take  to finish and then append to the queue

if the call stack is empty and element is in queue then EVENTLOOP will  take element from the quee and push into the callstack

event loop check if callback is empty , it takes from the queue and
