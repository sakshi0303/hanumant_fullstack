>props:

when we go to 
Home: 
    this is home page
    abc("abc")
About:
    this is about page
    abc("second")
    <abc title={data}/>


Reuseble Compoents 
fucntion abs(ans){
    console.log(ans)
}
Demo: child Component of aboutt and contact

Parent (ABout,Contact) to child (Demo)
child (Contact, About) to Parent (App.jsx)  --> through fucntion
child to child

props sending from parent to child and child to parent is alot, therefore we use ContextAPI , redux

navbar: bootstram
dummy json products : fetch('https://dummyjson.com/products')
